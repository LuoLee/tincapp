Main features:
 • Does NOT require root privilege
 • Connection management through a graphical interface
 • Uses conventional tinc configuration files (extended with support for encrypted private keys and VPN bypass per Android application)
 • Automatable using third party Android applications via Intents

Notes:
 • This application is only a VPN client, which is not tied to any VPN service provider by default.
 • It requires an existing tinc network to connect to.
 • For more information about the tinc VPN protocol, see https://www.tinc-vpn.org/

Platform specific limitations of the Android client:
 • Operates with tinc in router mode only
 • Connects to only one tinc network at a time
 • No support for hook scripts
